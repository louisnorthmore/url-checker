# url-checker

###Checks URL's are correctly redirected to their destination.  

We needed a solution for bulk checking a load of 301/302 redriects.
urls.csv should be a comma separated file consisting of two values: `<source_url>,<destination_url>`  
A summary is returned telling you how many are successful.

Please raise any issues you find.
